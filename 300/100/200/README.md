# 200 - Prerequisites

We recommend that you know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript before digging in to SolidStart. Since SolidStart is a SolidJS meta-framework, we also recommend you know SolidJS prior to digging in to these docs (or at least [take the SolidJS tutorial](https://www.solidjs.com/tutorial)).
