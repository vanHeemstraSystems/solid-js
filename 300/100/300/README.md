# 300 - SolidStart is in Beta!

We're very excited that you're checking out the SolidStart Beta release! Since SolidStart is in beta, you may find some bugs as you explore the framework. We would appreciate if you report these bugs to us using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-start/issues).

Beta means that while we are happy with the current state of the APIs, we are still learning by working with all of you. There are still opportunities for improvement and some changes before we reach 1.0. Thank you all for your patience, and we hope you enjoy exploring what is possible with SolidStart.
