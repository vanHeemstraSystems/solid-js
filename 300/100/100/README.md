# 100 - Features

SolidStart touts the following feature set:

- **Fine-grained reactivity**. Since SolidStart is a SolidJS meta-framework, it benefits from the fine-grained reactivity offered by SolidJS.
- **Isomorphic, nested routing**. You write the same routes regardless of whether the page is rendered on the client or server. Route nesting provides parent-child relationships that simplify application logic.
- **Multiple rendering modes**. SolidStart can be used to create CSR, SSR, streaming SSR, or SSG applications.
- **Command Line Interface (CLI) and templates**. Get up and running quickly with starters.
- **Deployment adapters**. SolidStart provides adapters to support deployment to your favorite platformâ€”Netlify, Vercel, AWS, and Cloudflare, to name a few.
